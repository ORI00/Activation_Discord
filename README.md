# Disclaimer:
Codes can be claimed multiple times, use bot's DM to make sure your code won't get stolen.<br>
In order to bypass that you should make the download link one time use only so people can't abuse it. <br>
It's a small project I decided to make, feel free to use.

# Purpose:

Simple discordjs bot which will send a user its virtual goods upon a code redemption.

# How to use:

1) npm install discord.js
2) Create config.json {"token": "yourdiscordbottoken"}
3) Change available codes and virtual good links (1 time use links are recommended)

Users will recieve their virtual item upon claiming their code (?redeem code) in their DM, codes can be set in the code, aswell as a link to the download. Keep in mind codes can be claimed multiple times so make sure that the virtual goods download link is a onetime use link.
